Structure of folders within Gwas

input_all: contains files that are needed for all GWAS runs in UK Biobank 
	-exclusion lists for related/ethnicity

code: contain all the program files that need to be run
	- qctool_run2.sh : subsets bgen files for use in snptest
	- snptest_run.sh: runs snptest on requested outcomes
	-folders.sh: creates the correct folder structure for other programs to work
	See individual read-mes for these programs at the end of this explanation

projects: contains folders for the inputs and outputs of each individual project
	General structure
		- Inputs: project specific inputs
			-eg. lists of snps, sample files containing outcomes
		- Bgen: (output from qctool) all the bgen files with names indexed by project and chr#
		- Outputs: Final association results 
		- Error reports: reports from running code NOTE THIS FOLDER MUST EXIST BEFORE RUNNING qctool_run and snptest_run



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

folders.sh: creates the correct folder structure for other programs to work. The error files for this will appear in your current working directory, afterwards everything happens in the new structure 

Run the commands below in the cardio terminal:

#USER INPUTS
# set working directory <- this is set to your scratch directory automatically
  cd /scratch//${USER}  
# set main directory for projects <- you must set this to the folder you want to keep the GWAS projects in
  main_dir="/scratch/am2609/Gwas"
# set name of your project   <- you must set this
  proj_name="Test"
#NO FURTHER INPUTS NEEDED  
# create the folders 
  sbatch --export=main_dir="${main_dir}",proj_name="${proj_name}" /scratch/am2609/Gwas/code_current/folders.sh

This will produce an error/out document for folders telling you if it complete sucessfully in you working directory. These can be deleted if the code ran without errors.
This can be safely run again for multiple projects - it will not over-write existing files. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

qctool_run2.sh: subsets the UKbiobank bgen files (as a single file)
requires as input: file address for .txt space seperated file listing the snps needed. They must be in the form chr:pos with leading zeros if chr<10 ( eg 06:160493099)

Run the commands below

# USER INPUTS
# set main directory for projects <- this should be the same as the main file given in folders.sh
  main_dir="/scratch/am2609/Gwas"
# set name of your project  <- this should be the same as the main file given in folders.sh
  proj_name="LPA"  
# set name for the outputed bgen file <- default is the same as the project name
  output_name="${proj_name}"   
# set input file containing snp list <- this should be the name of a file in the input folder 
  input_snps_file="lpa_snps_amy.txt"
# NO FURTHER INPUT NEEDED  
# create snp file address  
  input_snps_add="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/input/${input_snps_file}"
# folders for output 
  error_dir="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/errors"
  output_dir="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/bgen"
#run the command to extract the relevant snps from the .bgen files
  sbatch --export=input_snps="${input_snps_add}",output_dir="${output_dir}",output_name="${output_name}" --output="${error_dir}"/qctool_%A.out --error="${error_dir}"/qctool_%A.err "${main_dir}"/code/qctool_run2.sh
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

snptest_run.sh  : runs additive frequentist association tests on specified snps, for given outcomes 
This will loop round multiple outcomes, and run on unrelated european members of UKBiobank
It requires  1) a sample file containing the outcomes and principle components (and any other covariates of relevance), with a matching text file listing the outcomes to run snp test for in the inputs folder
2) a .bgen file containing the snps you want to run in the .bgen folder
3) .txt file listing the outcomes to run, one outcome per line. The file should be in the project input folder.
  
#USER INPUTS  
# set main directory for projects <- this should be the same as the main file given in folders.sh
  main_dir="/scratch/am2609/Gwas"
# set name of your project  <- this should be the same as the main file given in folders.sh
  proj_name="LPA"    
# set name for the associations file <- default is the same as the project name   
  output_name="${proj_name}" 
# set input file containing outcome names list <- this should be space seperated and placed in the input folder for that project
  input_file1="outcomes.txt"
# set covariates for snptest command <- default is first 10 principle components
  covar="PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 PC9 PC10"
# set sample file containing outcomes and covariates as requested in previous two files (this should be a .sample and placed in the input folder for that project)
  sample_file="lpa_HESoutcomes.sample"
# set bgen file name <- default name is the project name, should match qctool instruction above (this should be a .bgen file and in the bgen folder).  
  bgen_file_name="${proj_name}"
# NO FURTHER INPUT NEEDED  
# create input addresses

  output_dir="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/output"
#run command to run snptest

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

qctool_run.sh: subsets the UKbiobank bgen files (as one file per chromosone)
requires as input:  .txt space seperated file listing the snps needed. They must be in the form chr:pos with leading zeros if chr<10 ( eg 06:160493099) and the file should be in the project input folder


Run the commands below

# set main directory for projects
  main_dir="/scratch/am2609/Gwas"
# set name of your project  
  proj_name="LPA"  
# set input file containing snp list (this should be placed in the input folder for that project)
  input_snps_file="lpa_snps_amy.txt"
  input_snps_add="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/input/${input_snps_file}"
# set folders for output (as outlined in structure plan above)
  error_dir="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/errors"
  output_dir="${main_dir}/projects/${proj_name}/bgen"
# insert name for the outputed bgen files (I would suggest just using the project name, unless there are multiple extractions)
  output_name="${proj_name}" 
# list what chromosomes to extract from eg 1,2,3 or 1-22
  wanted_chrs=6

#run the command to extract the relevant snps from the .bgen files
# this starts as many processes as there are chromosomes
  sbatch --export=input_snps="${input_snps_add}",output_dir="${output_dir}",output_name="${output_name}" --output="${error_dir}"/qctool_%A_%a.out  --error="${error_dir}"/qctool_%A_%a.err --array="${wanted_chrs}" "${main_dir}"/code/qctool_run.sh
